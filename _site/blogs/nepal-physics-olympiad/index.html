<p>Nepal Physics Olympiad (NePhO) is an annual national level competition in physics organized by <a href="https://nps.org.np/">Nepal Physical Society (NPS)</a>. The top 5 contestants will be able to participate in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad">International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)</a>, representing Nepal team.</p>
<h3><strong>Eligibility</strong></h3>
<p>The participant must not have entered any university and must be under the age of 20 until June 30 of the participating year.</p>
<h3><strong>Form Availablity and Submission</strong></h3>
<p>The form is usually available in late January and must be submitted within around two weeks. You should refer to the notice provided by <a href="https://nps.org.np/">Nepal Physical Society (NPS)</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nepalphysics.olympiad">Nepal Physics Olympiad</a> for detailed information. You may even join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/382117412258231/">Facebook Group Nepal Physics Olympiad Discussion</a>. The forms will be provided to your school. So keep in touch with your teachers. In case it is not available in your school, contact the respective member for your area.</p>
<h3><strong>Structure of the Competition</strong></h3>
<p>The competition is carried out in two stages (both of which are 3 hours long theory exams):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-selection exam</strong>: It is conducted in mid-February in various cities (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bharatpur, Butwal, Nepalgunj, Dhangadi, and Mahendranagar in 2017). The syllabus for pre-selection exam is totally from grade 11, except the current electricity portion.

</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Final round</strong>: After the board exam of class 11 (0r 12, depending on the situation), the candidates will be given training for about a week and the final exam will be conducted selecting top 5 students for which the syllabus will contain concepts from grades 11 and 12  and basics of special relativity.</li>

<!-- ### Nepal Physics Olympiad 2019 (2075 BS)

As per the trend in recent years, the selections for International Physics Olympiad i.e. Nepal Physics Olympiad will most probably be held in the first week of Falgun (around the third week of February). I will update this blog once Nepal Physical Society releases the official notice for it. Keep checking. **Venue**:

- **Kathmandu**- Trichandra Multiple Campus, Ghantaghar,
- **Pokhara**- Prithivinarayan Multiple Campus (Science Building),
- **Biratnagar**- Mahendra Morang Multiple Campus,
- **Birgunj**- National Infotech,
- **Janakpur**- Ramshwaroop Ramsagar Multiple (RRM) Campus,
- **Bharatpur**- Birendra Multiple Campus,
- **Butwal**- Butwal Multiple Campus,
- **Nepalgunj**- Mahendra Multiple Campus
- **Dhangadhi**- Kailali Multiple Campus,
- **Mahendranagar**- Siddhanath Campus

**Registration fee**: Rs. 700/-

#### **How to register?**

First, check if you have forms in your college.

- If yes, you save yourself much time, and a bit of money (maybe Rs. 5). Get the form from the reception, fill it, and return back the form with the registration form. You are done.
- If no, you can download the form [here](12th-NePhO-Registration-Form-2018.pdf). Download and print the form. Fill in the form with accurate information and submit it to the office of Nepal Physical Society- Trichandra Campus, Ghantaghar along with the registration fee. -->
<h2>Cracking the Nepal Physics Olympiad</h2>
<p>If you see the above questions, you can find that preliminary round consists of just one or two out-of-the-box question, while most others are general questions, requiring concepts just like in +2. From our experience, getting into the top 20 isn't much difficult if you are OK in +2 physics. However, you will require some skills which are included in +2 physics syllabus but are not generally emphasized in school. Like analyzing and drawing graphs and error propagation. If you really do want to excel in any Physics Olympiad, you will require these skills.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error Propagation</strong>: If you are short of time or you are preparing just for Nepal Physics Olympiad, we would recommend <a href="https://www.geol.lsu.edu/jlorenzo/geophysics/uncertainties/Uncertaintiespart2.html">Uncertainty and Error Propagation</a> article by V Lindberg from RIT. But if you want in-depth knowledge of it from the very beginning (which will be required eventually in IPhO), the best material should be John R. Taylor's <a href="https://www.niser.ac.in/sps/sites/default/files/basic_page/John%20R.%20Taylor%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Error%20Analysis_%20The%20Study%20of%20Uncertainties%20in%20Physical%20Measurements-University%20Science%20Books%20(1997).pdf">An Introduction to Error Analysis</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Graph</strong>: You will also need the basics of Graph Plotting from the laboratory sessions of +2 and analysis of nature of graphs from Maths of Grade 11 (or you can find it in the initial chapters of physics books like University Physics or Principles of Physics-International Edition).</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>Which book should I follow?</h3>
<p>Depends on you.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are comfortable with maths, especially calculus, and are willing to get much more knowledge, <strong>University Physics</strong> should be the best choice.</li>
<li>If you are just OK with maths and are more willing to go for the logical or verbal concepts than its mathematics, <strong>Principles of Physics (International Edition)</strong> or <strong>Fundamentals of Physics (US Edition)</strong> would be a better option.</li>
<li>And if you think you are OK with concepts and just wanting the summary of concepts, or you want to check your concepts with some problems, <strong>HC Verma's Concepts of Physics</strong> should do for you. (But remember, it doesn't have application-type problems which are abundant in above books.)</li>
<li>Now at last, like physics, but don't enjoy reading the course books? Have a look at <strong>Richard Feynman's lectures collection</strong> in printed format or at <a href="http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu">feynmanlectures.caltech.edu</a>. You might fall in love.</li>
